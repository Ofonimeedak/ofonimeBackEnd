First Class Travel
 As she rode the escalator up from the crowded District 
 Line Abi glanced furtively at her watch.  Normally she 
 didnâ€™t allow herself to do that; to see the hands moving 
 inexorably round as she fought her way through the crowds
  was to invite stress in exponential waves.  If she left 
  it until she arrived on the teeming concourse of Liverpool
   Street station to look up at the clock and the departures 
   board and see which trains were  there  she could make a spot judgement. 
    Run or saunter or grab a coffee.  The stress was thereby minimised and the 
    element of variety  and even spontaneity was maintained.  She wondered if other commuters were reduced to playing games like this to keep themselves sane.  To look at their faces, she doubted it.  At this time of the day most people were grim, miserable or just plain dazed with exhaustion in equal measures.

Today had been particularly bad.  The crowds were if anything heavier 
than usual - probably because of the rain -  and she had had an especially exhausting afternoon in court.  A child custody case; the worst kind.  The 5.42 was still alongside Platform 11 and she had four minutes to get there.  With every step her briefcase and large shoulder bag grew heavier but on this occasion it was worth the hurry.  To get home as soon as possible, to have a cool bath and a long, lazy gin and tonic was the sole thing  on her mind at this moment.  It would be followed by a meal of some sort out of the freezer, sitting, if the rain had stopped, at the small wrought iron table on the terrace at the back of the cottage.
